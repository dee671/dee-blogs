            <h3>Here is my story</h3>
            <p> It all started, in the Philippines, in a province called Pampanga. As a kid I remember playing and feeling carefree from the 
                repercussions of any my actions. Sometimes even dreaming of soaring through the sky and visiting many foreing places and 
                meeting new people. Sadly, as the years passed this attitude slowly drifted and was replaced by constricted and limited thoughts
                brought upon experiences of not only mine but also bestowed by others. I have become SCARED...scared of the world and dangers it holds
                and instead of searching, mining for the beauty that it offers. I have sheeled myself from the experiences and enveloped my thoughts 
                and body with the illusion of safety. Away from harm, pain, and death. Never showing up to events and experiences that should, would, 
                and could have shaped my early years my early years. I have long regreted those days. The days with empty thoughts and whining soul. 
                That was then...
            </p>
            <p>
                Now... Thank goodness that life is an infinite possibilities. And that it has given this poor old soul, a new lease in life. I try 
                new things, meet and get to know new and interesting people, and experience life like back when I was a kid. Come join me in this journey
                whether you are your or old, we can learn from one another through our experiences and values built while on this earth. 
                I cant wait to see you progress in this quest we call life.
